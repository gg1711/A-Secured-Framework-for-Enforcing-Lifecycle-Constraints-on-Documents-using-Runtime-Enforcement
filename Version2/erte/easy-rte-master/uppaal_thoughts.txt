1. accepting states are urgent, as we don't care if time passes in them
2. non-accepting states are normal, and they must have invariants

longest trace of urgent states * wcrt to get response time



1. environment has three states
 transition 1 do inputs
 transition 2 run enforcer
 transition 3 run policy

2. Compile to policy monitor and enforcer
 enforcer clocks replaced with (clock + 1)

3. Ensure violation state never reached.
